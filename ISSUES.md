# Issues

## Frontend PUBLIC_URL

Currently, the routing on the cloud does not work. If switched to Create-react-app, it will work.

## Async Subscription

Some components that have large resource requirements may not yet be set for unmounting.

## Responsiveness

TODO

## Xlsx-populate

- No support for saved multiple selection (use multiple selection then save the excel file). No work around at the moment.

## Heavy Loads

Only heavy loads, the application hangs. We could use a web-worker to handle the processing in the background.
