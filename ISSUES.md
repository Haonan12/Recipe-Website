# Issues

## Frontend PUBLIC_URL

Currently, the routing on the cloud does not work. If switched to Create-react-app, it will work.

## Async Subscription

Some components that have large resource requirements may not yet be set for unmounting.

## Responsiveness

TODO

## Draft-js

It seems that there is an issue with multiple Editors with focus.

The formula bar input auto focuses on page refresh.
