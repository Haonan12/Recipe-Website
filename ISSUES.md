# Issues

## Chunks

Sometimes, the website crashes or slows down because of lazy rendered components.

Currently, removing lazy rendering is the only solution at the moment. It may be tied with webpack...

## Frontend PUBLIC_URL

Currently, the routing on the cloud does not work. If switched to Create-react-app, it will work.

## Async Subscription

Some components that have large resource requirements may not yet be set for unmounting.

## Excel Selection

Only selection on the bottom right pane works.

## Responsiveness

TODO
