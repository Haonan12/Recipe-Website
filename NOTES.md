# Notes

## Maintenance (TODO)

Some parameters in the table may contain values from another table.

Some of these values may not be up to date due to performance issues.

However, we keep reference to the _id in order to regularly (weekly basis or so) update the values

## Design

For a flat table, we may not need an attributes/categories page

## History

https://redux.js.org/recipes/implementing-undo-history

## Input expansion

We need the ref of the window to get the offset.

Autosizer already gives the heigh and width of the window.

Current cell position gives the starting point of the cell.
