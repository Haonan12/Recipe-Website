# TODOS

## Prioritized

- [ ] Users Pagination
- [ ] Token blacklist
- [ ] User validation (registration or user management)
- [ ] Scope for approving registration
- [ ] Scope for modifying user
- [ ] Webpack hostname - route production build with public URL (CRA can do it)

## Unprioritized

- [ ] Miscellaneous information - ie: job positions
- [ ] General and route error handlers- should everything be handled here or do it in the original route? (General error handler handles most errors but may not make sense for some routes)
- [ ] Strengthen verfication ids (change MongoDB Id to a more secure Id -- MongoDB Id is too predicatable)
- [ ] Logout anchor or change style
