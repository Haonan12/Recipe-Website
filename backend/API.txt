Stateless (mostly)
===========================
- This app uses token-based authentication rather than sessions
- The benefit of this is that the server does not have to store memory, which can be a problem when many users are present. Tokens are also used for authentication, which 
  provides another layer of security.
- The drawback of this is that subsequent requests will fetch the same authentication resources for authenticated routes
- Another issue is where to store the token. There are multiple storages on the client side, but one of the simplest and better alternative would be sessions...
  Although we still use sessions, token comes with authentication.
